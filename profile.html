                <p>Philip Abrams, a 78-year-old semi-retired businessman, was persuaded to invest $300,000 in two private companies through the defendant Sprott Securities Limited, a well-known Canadian stock brokerage firm. To make this investment, Mr. Abrams was required to sign documents stating that he was a sophisticated investor and that he understood the risks involved (even though he did not understand those risks). Mr. Abrams lost his entire investment. He sued Sprott to recover his losses, claiming that Sprott breached its duties by allowing him to invest such a large sum in speculative investments while failing to provide complete and accurate information about the risks. At trial, Sprott argued that the case should be dismissed because Mr. Abrams had acknowledged in writing that he understood the risks he was taking. Instead, the trial judge found that Sprott had not adequately explained the risks to Mr. Abrams and that he did not understand the risks, and awarded Mr. Abrams 50% of his losses. Sprott appealed to the Court of Appeal, but <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2003/2003canlii27136/2003canlii27136.html" target="_blank">its appeal was dismissed.</a></p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2012/2012onca677/2012onca677.html" target="_blank">Fairlie v. Benesure</a></h3> 

                <p>In this case, for the first time in Ontario, the Court of Appeal allowed a party to a contract to sue for monetary damages for “equitable fraud” based on “unconscionable” (grossly unfair) conduct by the other contracting party. The defendant was alleged to have improperly solicited the plaintiff’s customers by various unscrupulous methods. </p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2012/2012onsc6582/2012onsc6582.html" target="_blank">Ferraton v. Shular</a></h3>  

                <p>In this case (currently under appeal), a former friend persuaded Mr. Shular, who was in an emotionally fragile state, to sign an agreement to pay her the equivalent of a 44% commission for “arranging for the sale” of Mr. Shular’s house. The trial judge ruled that the agreement was unenforceable because it was “unconscionable” (grossly unfair), and because the former friend was not a licensed real estate agent and was therefore not entitled to charge a commission. </p>

                <h3>Hamilton v. CNR</h3>

                <p>Suzanne Hamilton, a nine-year-old girl, was struck and killed by a train in Mississauga. Her mother sued the railway (CNR). CNR denied that it was responsible in any way for the accident, and also argued (in accordance with previous judges’ decisions) that the death of a child was worth much less (in monetary compensation) than the death of an adult. The jury did not agree with CNR, found CNR partially responsible for the accident, and made the highest general damage assessment for the death of a young child in Canadian history up to that time. CNR appealed both the finding of liability and the amount of the damages. The Court of Appeal confirmed the jury’s finding of liability, but reduced the damage assessment; however, even the reduced assessment was still the highest in Canada.

                <h3>Atkins v. Holubeshen</h3>
                 
                <p>Ms. Atkins was injured in a car accident and sued the driver of the car that struck her. Her former lawyer was very slow in providing documents to the insurance company’s lawyer, and finally agreed (without Ms. Atkins’ knowledge or consent) that if he did not provide the required documents by a certain date, the insurance company could have the lawsuit dismissed. Ms. Atkins’ lawyer did not comply with the deadline, and her lawsuit was therefore dismissed. For the next two years her lawyer kept telling her that the case was proceeding to trial, although that was untrue.  She eventually checked with the court office and discovered that her claim had been dismissed two years earlier. She then hired Mr. Wainberg, who brought a motion to the court to set aside the dismissal and to permit the case to proceed to trial. The judge who heard the motion decided that Ms. Atkins should not lose her claim because of the negligence of her former lawyer, and reinstated the action. The insurance company appealed to the Ontario Divisional Court and then to the Court of Appeal, but both appeals were dismissed. </p>
